## Image Conditional Diffusion Model for Supervised Learning

### Introduction

Diffusion models have been widely used for image processing tasks such as denoising and inpainting. These models are based on the idea of propagating information from known to unknown pixels in an image, using a set of diffusion equations. The Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) is a recent addition to the family of diffusion models, which has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on image denoising tasks.

One limitation of DDIM and other diffusion models is their inability to incorporate additional information about the image, such as the presence of certain object classes or features. In this proposal, we propose to extend DDIM by adding a conditional image input to the model, allowing it to make use of this additional information for improved performance on image segmentation tasks.

### Background

One limitation of current diffusion models is that they are typically limited to performing tasks such as denoising and inpainting, and may not be well-suited for other image processing tasks such as image classification or segmentation. This is because diffusion models are based on the idea of propagating information from known to unknown pixels in an image, using a set of diffusion equations. While this approach can be effective for tasks such as denoising, where the goal is to smooth out noise and recover the underlying signal in an image, it may not be as effective for tasks that require more complex reasoning and decision-making, such as classifying an image or segmenting it into different regions.

Another limitation of current diffusion models is that they are typically designed to operate on static images, and may not be easily extended to video or other temporal data. This can be a disadvantage, as many real-world applications involve processing video or other temporal data, and models that are able to handle such data may have an advantage.

Finally, current diffusion models are typically limited to processing 2D images, and may not be easily extended to 3D data such as 3D images or point clouds. This can be a limitation for applications that involve 3D data, such as medical imaging or computer vision for robotics.

### Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to develop an image conditional diffusion model (ICDM) for supervised learning, based on the DDIM framework. The ICDM will be trained to perform image segmentation by predicting a segmentation map for a given input image, conditioned on an additional input image that contains information about the desired object classes or features.

### Methods

To achieve this objective, we will follow the following steps:

1.  Implement the ICDM framework by modifying the DDIM model to accept an additional conditional image input.
2.  Train the ICDM on a dataset of images and corresponding segmentation maps, using the conditional image as additional input.
3.  Evaluate the performance of the ICDM on image segmentation tasks, and compare it to the performance of existing diffusion models and other state-of-the-art image segmentation methods.

### Expected results

We expect the ICDM to outperform existing diffusion models and other state-of-the-art image segmentation methods on a variety of image datasets, by making use of the additional information provided by the conditional image input. In particular, we expect the ICDM to be able to accurately segment objects of different classes or with different features, based on the information provided by the conditional image.

### Conclusion

In this proposal, we have presented a novel approach for improving the performance of diffusion models on image segmentation tasks, by incorporating additional information about the desired object classes or features through a conditional image input. We believe that the ICDM framework has the potential to significantly advance the state of the art in image segmentation, and look forward to evaluating its performance on a variety of datasets.
